To run the website type:
    uvicorn main:app --reload
    fastapi run main.py

The <--reload> option can cause issues because it spawns multiple processes.
Use an external terminal to prevent it from getting stuck.
Use <--timeout-graceful-shutdown 5> to force shutdown within 5 seconds.

Using path to get specified resource is not recommended because similar paths may cause conflicts.
They can not be overwritten so the first path always runs and blocks others.

"/docs" directory shows the developer a tree of the page.

When creating new courses, without a specified schema, the "course" parameter will accept any valid JSON object.


# Get courses by title (using path)
@app.get("/courses/{course_title}")
async def get_courses_by_title(course_title: str):
    courses = []
    for course in courses_db:
        if course.get("title").lower() == course_title.lower():
            courses.append(course)
    return courses

# Get course by id (using path) [this function will never be called because of the similarity]
@app.get("/courses/{course_id}")
async def get_course_by_id(course_id: int):
    for course in courses_db:
        if course.get("id") == course_id:
